## AWS Monitoring & Logging Pipeline (Terraform)

🚀 Overview

This repository contains a Terraform-based solution to deploy a fully automated monitoring & logging pipeline in AWS using core services. The pipeline emphasizes observability, auditability, and integration with AWS’s native tooling.

Using this project, you can provision:
	•	CloudTrail for capturing API logs
	•	S3 buckets for log storage
	•	CloudWatch logs & metrics
	•	SNS / SQS for alerts or decoupled processing
	•	Kinesis Firehose (or other streaming components)
	•	DynamoDB (for tracking / state / indexing)
	•	Other supporting infrastructure modules

All managed in Terraform, with modular design for reusability and flexibility.

	•	terraform/ — the core Terraform project
	•	modules/ — reusable submodules (S3, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, SNS, SQS, etc.)
	•	.github/workflows/ — workflows for testing, linting, plan/apply, etc.

✅ Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
	1.	AWS CLI configured (or environment credentials) with sufficient IAM permissions.
	2.	Terraform (v1.x) installed locally.
	3.	An AWS account/region where you can deploy the resources.
	4.	Optionally, GitHub credentials / secrets if doing CI/CD.

🛠 Setup & Deployment

Here’s how to get the pipeline deployed:

```
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shehuj/aws_monitoring_and_logging_pipeline-TF.git
cd aws_monitoring_and_logging_pipeline-TF/terraform

# 2. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 3. (Optional) Review plan
terraform plan -out plan.out

# 4. Apply
terraform apply plan.out

# 5. Destroy (if needed)
terraform destroy
```

Note: Before running apply, make sure to supply any required variables via:
	•	terraform.tfvars
	•	CLI -var flags
	•	Environment variables
	•	Terraform Cloud / backend variable sets (if applicable)

⚙️ Modules & Components Description

Here’s a brief on what each module does:

Module
Purpose
s3
Creates S3 buckets for storing logs, artifacts, audit data
cloudtrail
Enables AWS CloudTrail across accounts/regions for audit logging
cloudwatch
Builds CloudWatch log groups, metrics, dashboards, alarms
sns
Sets up SNS topics for alerting / notifications
sqs
SQS queues for decoupling or buffering
kinesis-firehose
Streaming or delivery of logs to targets (e.g. S3, Redshift)
dynamodb
Storage for state, indexing, or lookup as part of the logging pipeline

You can customize or extend modules as needed (e.g. add Kinesis Data Streams, Lambda functions, etc.).

🧪 Testing & CI/CD Integration

In the .github/workflows folder, you should (or can) include workflows such as:
	•	Terraform Lint & Format — validate Terraform code style
	•	Plan / Apply — automatically run terraform plan on PRs and terraform apply on merges
	•	Policy / Security Scans — e.g. check for insecure S3 buckets, overly permissive IAM, etc.

Example workflow steps might include:
	•	Checkout repo
	•	Install Terraform
	•	terraform fmt / terraform validate
	•	terraform plan
	•	Post plan output as a PR comment (if permissions allow)
	•	On merge, run terraform apply

Be sure to configure GitHub secrets for AWS access (or use OIDC role assumption) for the workflows.

🔐 IAM & Security Considerations
	•	Ensure IAM roles used by Terraform have least privilege to create/manage only the needed resources.
	•	Audit S3 bucket policies, ensure encryption (SSE), block public access.
	•	Enable log integrity and encryption for CloudTrail.
	•	Use IAM conditions (such as restricting from certain IPs or VPCs) where applicable.
	•	Monitor/remove unused modules or resources to minimize attack surface.

🧩 Example Use Case / Flow
	1.	A user pushes Terraform changes via a pull request.
	2.	The CI workflow runs linting, validation, and a terraform plan.
	3.	A reviewer reviews and merges the PR.
	4.	On merge, the CD workflow runs terraform apply.
	5.	The deployed infrastructure begins streaming logs, enabling alerting, dashboards, and central observability.

📥 Outputs & Access

After deployment, Terraform outputs may include:
	•	Names / ARNs of S3 buckets for logs
	•	CloudWatch dashboard URLs
	•	SNS topic ARNs
	•	Kinesis delivery stream ARNs
	•	IAM roles and ARNs

You can use those outputs to integrate with application services, dashboards, or further automation.

🛠 Tips & Customization
	•	Modular additions: integrate Lambda functions for log processing, or push logs to destinations like Elasticsearch / OpenSearch.
	•	Multi-account / multi-region: extend modules to assume roles across accounts or replicate logs cross-region.
	•	Alerting: define CloudWatch alarms, SNS + Lambda or Slack notification integrations.
	•	Retention policies: customize S3 and CloudWatch log retention times.
	•	Cost controls: tag all resources, use budgets / alerts on cost overruns.

📄 License & Contribution
	•	License: (Add your license here, e.g. MIT, Apache 2.0)
	•	Feel free to contribute via pull requests.
	•	Please open issues for bugs, enhancements, or questions.

⚠️ Known Issues & Future Work
	•	S3 bucket name collisions — ensure unique bucket names
	•	IAM policy drift — manually review permissions
	•	Region / service limits — monitor quotas
	•	Extend support to more AWS services (e.g. EventBridge, Log Insights)
	•	Improve CI/CD with drift detection and auto-rollback
